* Follow-along with Guide tab in lab
* While the update is running in CloudFormation, open a separate tab to watch what happens with the EC2 as the CloudFormation stack progresses through its update events
* Attempt to delete the stack and see how termination protection prevents deletion of the stack
* Notice that you're still able to terminate the EC2 instance normally (outside of CloudFormation)
