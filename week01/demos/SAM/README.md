# SAM Demo

**Need to install SAM - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/install-sam-cli.html or run in Cloud9 environment in sandbox**

* Run `sam init` and choose 1 ("AWS Quickstart")
* Choose "Hello World Example"
* Use defaults
* `N` for X-Ray
* Give it the name "sam-hello-world"
* Open "sam-hello-world" folder in VS Code
* Walk through the various source files generated by the SAM CLI
* Run `sam build --use-container` (requires Docker to be running); if running in Cloud9, already running
* Run `sam local invoke` (could use event.json to define inputs)
* Run `sam local start-api` (`curl http://localhost:3000/hello`)
* Run `sam deploy --guided` (if running using ACG sandbox, will have to remove app insights)
* **NOTE: If you've already attempted to run the deploy, you'll need to delete the stack before running again. Rerun `sam build --use-container` before rerunning `sam deploy --guided`.**
* Test using API Gateway in MC
* Try making a change to message and rerun `sam build --use-container` and `sam deploy --guided`
* Also, able to package up as a cloud formation template and deploy using that template
* Run `AWS_SAM_STACK_NAME=<stack name here> pytest` to show unit/integration tests (**NOTE: You may need to run `pip install pytest`, `pip install boto3`, and/or `pip install requests` if running `pytest` in Cloud9 (see `requirements.txt`).**)
